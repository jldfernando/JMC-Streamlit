1. A way for CCO to add/remove/modify visits, tours, events
2. A calendar to display these visits, tours, events
3. You can select the event on the calendar to assign, reassign, see who is available, and templates
4. no need for manual schedule availaility inputs
5. A way for the team to input their schedule and potential absences -- maybe just regular class schedule
6. A way for capts to easily monitor declared attendance
7. A way to visualize the visits, tours, events
8. Approval tracker?
9. A way to create, & delete accounts
10. A way to remind JMCs when they have a visit coming
11. Quick links hub
